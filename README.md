Is just a version of the last project in the JS tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ&pp=ygUmamF2YXNjcmlwdCBmdWxsIGNvdXJzZSBiZWdpbm5lciB0byBwcm8%3D
I was guided for the dude but ultimatly i made "my own" version, with all the extensions of every exercise given at the end of each lesson.
I think the main difference with the version in the tutorial is that you can see the products update in real time when you search for them (that means the search botton is for nothing lol)
also, in the tutorial the dude made a function that calculates the cart quantity, i just add a cartQuantity property to the class cart, and everytime i add or delete a product
of the cart, it will update that value. Is better because when you want the cart quantity it will not enter a for loop as in the tutorial version, it will give you the value
directly from the property...
And, if a remember correctly once you commit the order and the car gets empty, if you comeback to checkout.js and press the botton again, it crashes lol.
But i will not change it jajaja, maybe another day.
